API changes:

* Fix `user_interface.nim` by:
  - Mangling `uint32_t` -> `uint32`
  - Use updated `c2nim_esp8266` which joins successive pragmas to avoid compilation errors

Other changes:

* Added `mostlyclean` target which cleans everything except for the downloads
* Print the output of C2NIM when VERBOSE=1
